            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>White Water Rapids Adventures was founded in 1995 by adventurous friends Sarah Thompson and Jake Rogers. What started as a small passion project to share their love of white water rafting with close friends and family soon grew into a thriving business. Sarah and Jake, both seasoned rafting guides with years of experience navigating some of the most challenging rivers in North America, saw an opportunity to create a unique rafting experience that combined safety, fun, and a deep appreciation for nature.</p>
            <p>Over the years, White Water Rapids Adventures expanded its operations from a single raft to a full fleet of state-of-the-art rafts and equipment. The company has guided thousands of adventurers down the roaring rivers of Colorado, Oregon, and beyond. Their commitment to safety, exceptional customer service, and sustainable tourism has earned them numerous awards and a loyal following of repeat customers.</p>
            <p>Today, White Water Rapids Adventures remains family-owned and operated, with Sarah and Jake's children now playing active roles in the business. They continue to uphold the company's core values of adventure, respect for nature, and creating unforgettable experiences for every rafter. Whether you're a first-time rafter or a seasoned pro, White Water Rapids Adventures promises an exhilarating journey that you'll remember for a lifetime.</p>
